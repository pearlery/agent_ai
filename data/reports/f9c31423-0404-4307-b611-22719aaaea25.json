    "markdown_report": "# Executive Summary\nThe alert indicates a potential UAC bypass via Sdclt.exe on host yb-lt2338.yomabank.org, but the analysis was marked as a false positive. The severity is high, and the primary finding is related to the execution of FileCoAuth.exe from OneDrive. The event was detected on March 20, 2025.\n\n# Alert Details\n- **Timestamp**: 2025-03-20T01:11:38.959Z\n- **Hostname**: yb-lt2338.yomabank.org\n- **Key Indicators**: \n  - Multiple executions of \"C:\\Users\\moetheingioo\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\OneDrive\\25.031.0217.0003\\FileCoAuth.exe\" with the command line argument \"-Embedding\"\n  - Parent process: c:\\windows\\system32\\svchost.exe\n  - Source IP: 192.168.100.28\n  - User: yb-lt2338$\n\n# In-Depth Technical Analysis\nThe alert was triggered by multiple instances of FileCoAuth.exe being executed with the \"-Embedding\" argument. All instances were spawned by svchost.exe, which is a legitimate Windows service. The events were classified as \"audit_success,\" indicating that the executions were successful. The alert was ultimately marked as a false positive, suggesting that the activity was likely benign. The repeated execution of FileCoAuth.exe could be related to legitimate OneDrive functionality.\n\n# MITRE ATT&CK Framework Mapping\n- **Tactic**: Defense Evasion, Privilege Escalation\n- **Technique**: T1548.002 - Bypass User Account Control (Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism)\n\n# Recommended Mitigation & Response Steps\n\n## 1. Immediate Containment (Short-Term)\n**Step 1.1 - Isolate Host:**\n- **Action**: Immediately isolate the host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.\n- **Tool**: Use CrowdStrike Falcon (EDR) to isolate the host.\n\n**Step 1.2 - Investigate with Available Tools:**\n- **Action**: Search for similar activity using available monitoring tools to determine if this is an isolated incident.\n- **Tool**: Use Splunk (SIEM) to analyze logs for similar events.\n\n## 2. Strategic Hardening (Long-Term)\n- Monitor OneDrive and related processes for unusual activity.\n- Ensure that the CrowdStrike Falcon (EDR) and Splunk are properly configured to detect and alert on similar events in the future.\n- Regularly review and update the configuration of security tools to minimize false positives.\n\n## 3. Additional Recommendations\n- Consider implementing additional monitoring on the host yb-lt2338.yomabank.org to detect any potential malicious activity.\n- Review the configuration and usage of OneDrive on the host to ensure it aligns with organizational policies.\n\nBy following these steps, the organization can further enhance its security posture and minimize the risk of similar events in the future.",
