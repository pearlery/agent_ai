    "tactic": "Privilege Escalation",
    "confidence_score": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "The alert name 'WINDOWS METHODOLOGY [UAC Bypass via Sdclt.exe]' suggests a potential UAC bypass technique, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique 'T1548.002 - Bypass User Account Control'. Although the log events show 'FileCoAuth.exe' executions, the alert name indicates that the detection is related to UAC bypass, likely through a similar mechanism. The presence of 'T1548.002' in the 'mitre' section of the log data further supports this conclusion. The tactic is identified as 'Privilege Escalation' due to the nature of UAC bypass techniques, which are used to elevate privileges."
