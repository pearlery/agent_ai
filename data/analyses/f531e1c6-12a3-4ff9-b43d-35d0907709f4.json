    "tactic": "Privilege Escalation",
    "confidence_score": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "The alert name 'WINDOWS METHODOLOGY [UAC Bypass via Sdclt.exe]' suggests a potential UAC bypass technique, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique 'T1548.002 - Bypass User Account Control'. Although the log data doesn't directly show 'Sdclt.exe', the repeated execution of 'FileCoAuth.exe' with the '-Embedding' flag, spawned from 'svchost.exe', could indicate an abuse of a legitimate process for potentially malicious purposes. The MITRE ATT&CK techniques listed in the log data include 'T1548.002', supporting the likelihood of a UAC bypass attempt. The case was marked as 'FalsePositives', which slightly reduces confidence, but the alert's 'High' severity and the presence of 'T1548.002' in the MITRE techniques list maintain a reasonable confidence level."
