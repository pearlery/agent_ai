    "tactic": "Privilege Escalation",
    "confidence_score": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "The alert name 'WINDOWS METHODOLOGY [UAC Bypass via Sdclt.exe]' suggests a potential UAC bypass technique, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique 'T1548.002 - Bypass User Account Control'. Although the log events show 'FileCoAuth.exe' executions, the alert name indicates that the detection is related to UAC bypass, likely through a similar mechanism. The MITRE ATT&CK techniques listed in the log data also include 'T1548.002', supporting this conclusion. The case was marked as 'FalsePositives', which slightly reduces confidence, but the alert details still point towards 'T1548.002'."
