    "tactic": "Privilege Escalation",
    "confidence_score": 0.8,
    "reasoning": "The alert name 'WINDOWS METHODOLOGY [UAC Bypass via Sdclt.exe]' suggests a potential UAC bypass technique, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique 'T1548.002 - Bypass User Account Control'. Although the log data doesn't directly show 'Sdclt.exe', the repeated execution of 'FileCoAuth.exe' with the '-Embedding' flag, spawned from 'svchost.exe', could indicate an abuse of a legitimate process for potentially malicious purposes. The MITRE ATT&CK techniques listed in the log data also include 'T1548.002', supporting this conclusion. However, the absence of direct evidence of 'Sdclt.exe' or other clear indicators of UAC bypass in the provided events reduces the confidence score."
